    <h1>Backtrcking</h1>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these After you make your choice you will get
       a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over untilyou
        reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state, if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree, the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the
       leavesare all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its chidren to move 
       to,and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad lea! You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice and trying out
       the next option in that set of options If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node.
       If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <img src="./root img.png" alt="root img" width="250px">
    <ol>
      <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li><br>
      <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li><br>
      <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li><br>
      <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li><br>
      <li>Dis bad Go back to A.</li><br>
      <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>
      <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>
      <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li><br>
      <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li><br>
    </ol>

      <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is
         also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual
          tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

    <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2>
    <fieldset>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <font color="blue">
          boolean solve(Node n) {

            if n is a leaf node {
            
               if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            
               else return false

            } else {
            
               for each child c of n{
            
                   if solve(c) succeeds, return true
               }    
            
              return false
              }
            }    
            </font>

        </code>
      </pre>
    </fieldset><br><br>
    <fieldset>
      Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that
       means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is 
       solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </fieldset>
    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If any child of n is solvable, then ry is solvable.</li>
      <li>If no child of n is solvable, then in is not solvable.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>Hence to decide whether any non-leaf node his solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of n is
       solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
    <fieldset>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <font color="blue">
            for each child c of n {

             if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            } 

            return false
          </font>
        </code>
      </pre>
    </fieldset><br>
    <p>Eventually the recursion "bottom node, it is not solvable. This is our base at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable,
       if the leaf node is not a goal In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
    <fieldset>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <font color="blue">
            if n is a leaf node {

              if the leaf is a goal node, return true

                else return false
            }   
          </font>
        </code>
      </pre>
    </fieldset><br><br>
    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simle but important. you should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p>
    <h3>to search a tree:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
      <li> Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack </h3>
    <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm in fact, that is 
      how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>
    <fieldset>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <font color="blue">
            boolean solve(Node n) {
             put node n on the stack;
              while the stack is not empty {
                if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
                  if it is a goal node, return true 
                   else pop it off the stack
                }
                 else{
                  if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                     push the next untried child onto the stack
                  else pop the node off the stack
                   
                 }
                 
                return false
                }
              </font>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </fieldset>
   <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack, and
     these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed 
     from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore if the root node gets removed (making the
      stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the problem.</p>
   <p>When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.</p>
   <p>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path Information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive
     calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the current level,
      or storing it in an array.</p>
   <p>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm; modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p> 
   <fieldset>
    <pre>
      <code>
        <font color="blue">
          boolean solve(Node n) {

            if n is a leaf node{
            
            if the leaf is a goal node{ 
              
              print n
              
              return true
            }  
            
            else return false
            
            } else {
            
            for each child c of n {
              
              if solve(c) succeeds { 
                
                print n
                
                return true
              }
            }    
            return false
          }
        } 
            
        </font>
      </code>
    </pre>
   </fieldset>  
   <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
   <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up
     with details Even determing whether the node is a leat can be complex:</p>
   <p>for example, if the path represents a sones of oven in a chess andgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions
   </p>
   <p>To keep the program clean therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for temple, you could test whether a node
     is a leaf by writing <b> gameOver method </b> (or you could even call it <b> isLeaf).</b> This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out
      whether any possible moves remain</p>
   <p>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have been tried 
    already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b> for each child c of n. </b> In reality,
     it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example,
      a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece
       has made a legal move How do you find these children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined?
  </p>
  <p>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that
     is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list When the list is empty,
      there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure" This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional
       work
  </p>             
  <p>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on the children if there ordering, and
     you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next
  </p>
  <p>For example, you might be able to number the <b> children 1 through n,</b> and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just led <b> child k,</b> you 
    know that you have ready tried children 1 through <b>k-1,</b>  and you have not yet trod children <b> k+1 </b> through <b> n.</b> Or, if you are trying to color a map 
    with just four colors, you can always try <b> red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b> If child yellow falls, you know to try child green 
    next if you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order telt, straight, night <b></b> (or perhaps north, east, south, west).</b>
  </p>
  <p>It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. In the chess game example, you might number your preces for perhaps
     the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order but in addition each place may also have several moves and these must also be 
     ordered.</p>
  <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>  
  <p>for starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will so use the simplest kind of 
    thee a binary tree.</p>
  <p>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to) zero, one,
     or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are
      reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition
       of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name The firm example in this paper 
       (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree</p>            
  <p>Here's a definition of the Binary Tree class:
  </p> 
  <fieldset>
    <pre>
      <code>
        <font color="blue">
          public class Binary Tree {

           BinaryTree leftChild = null; 
           
           BinaryTree rightChild = null;
            
           boolean isGoalNode = false;

           String name;

           Binary Tree(String name, Binary Tree left. Binary Tree right, boolean isGoalNode) {

            this.name = name;

            leftChild left;

            rightChild = right;

            this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
           }
          } 
        </font>
      </code>
    </pre>
  </fieldset>       
  <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method make Tree() which constructs the above binary tree</p>
  <fieldset>
    <pre>
      <code>
        <font color="blue">
          static Binary Tree makeTree() {

            Binary Tree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;

            c = new Binary Tree("C", null, null, false);

            d = new Binary Tree("D", null, null, false);

            e = new Binary Tree("E", null, null, true);

            f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false); 
            
            a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);

            b = new Binary Tree("B", e, f, false);

            root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);

            return root;
          }  
        </font>
      </code>
    </pre>
  </fieldset>
 <p>Here's a main program to create a binary free and try to solve it:</p>
 <fieldset>
  <pre>
    <code>
      <font color="blue">
        public static void main(String args[]){

          Binary Tree tree-makeTree();

          System.out.println(solvable(tree));
        } 

      </font>
    </code>
  </pre>
 </fieldset>
 <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
 <fieldset>
  <pre>
    <code>
      <font color="blue">
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){

        /*1*/ if (node == null) return false;
      
        /*2*/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
      
        /*3*/ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
      
        /*4*/ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
      
       /*5*/ return false; 
      }    
      </font>
    </code>
  </pre>
   </fieldset>
   <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
   <p>1. If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node,
     withoutfirst checking whether those children actually exit.
  </p>
  <p>2. If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.
  </p>
  <p>3.See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null
     and is not a goal node, says to</p>
  <p>4. Do the same thing for the right child.</p>
  <p>5. Since neither child of node in solvable, node itself is not solvable.</p>
  <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.
  </p>
  <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null in the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An
     alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>
  <fieldset>
    <pre>
      <code>
        <font color="blue">
          static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {

            if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
            
            if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;
            
            if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
            
            return false;
            
          }
        </font>
      </code>
    </pre>
  </fieldset>
  <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What are children?</h3>
  <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices.
     Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the soft and the right child are 
     possible solutions in many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children Imediately, without recursion.
  </p>
  <p>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map, it is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted 
    the countries are, can the colored with at most four colors so that no two countries that share a border are the same color.</p>
  <p>To color a map, you choose a calor for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored.</p>
  <p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
    <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of countries
      you have successfully colored the map.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a checkerboard
     only needs two color.</p>
  <p><b>boolean mapIsOK()</b></p>
  <p>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf nodel whether the entire map is colored correctly.</p><br>
  <p><b> boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</b></p>
  <p>Used by method 2 to check at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color,</p><br>
  <p><b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</b></p>
  <p>Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).
  </p><br>
  <p>Here's the code for method 1:</p>
  <fieldset>
    <pre>
      <code>
        <font color="blue">
          boolean explore1 (int row, int column, int color) {

           if (row>= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOK();

           map[row][column] = color;

           for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {

              int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);

              if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;

           }  

            return false; 

          }  
        </font>
      </code>
    </pre>
  </fieldset>
  <p>And here's the code for method 2:</p>
  <fieldset>
    <pre>
      <code>
        <font color="blue">
          boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {

            if (row >= NUM_ROWS) return true;
            
            if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
            
                map[row][column] = color;
            
                for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
            
                    int[] next nextRowAndColumn(row, column);
            
                    if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
                   
                }
                
              }  
            
            return false;

          } 
        </font>

  <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing infomatio suggest otherwise: </p>

  <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods
     could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this wit often prevent exponential
      growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way 
      to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>

  <h2>Debugging techniques</h2>
  <p><b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b> </p>
  <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably want to
     print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's
      hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries, Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p><b>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.
  </b></p>
  <p>Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in
     the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.

  <p><b>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.</b></p>
  <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual
     program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?</p>
  <p>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging Information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to your manager)
    . You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace every
     return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into
      your program.</p>
  <p>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>
  <fieldset>
    <pre>
      <code>
        <font color=" blue">
          static final boolean debugging = false;

          static void enter(Binary Tree node) {

            if (debugging) {

               System.out.println(indent+ "Entering solvable("+name(node)+")");

               indent = indent + 15

            }
            
          }  



          static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {

             if (debugging) {

              Indent = Indent.substring(3);

          System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node)+") returns true");

             }

              return true;
            }  



            static boolean no(Binary Tree node) {

              if (debugging) {

                  indent = indent.substring(3);

                  System.out.println(indent + "solvable("+name(node) + ") returns false");

              }

              return false;

            }
          </font>
        </code>
      </pre>
    </fieldset>
    <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your 
      code larger, modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will be
       discarded.
    </p>
    <p><b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b></p>
    <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream).
       Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions However, Java programmers don't always realize
        that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following code</p>
    <fieldset>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <font color="blue">
            new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
          </font>
        </code>
      </pre>
    </fieldset>
    <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print
       statement.</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <font color="blue">

    <h3>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h3>
    <p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles and the same number of white
       marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1 spaces to put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all
        at one end (say, the left), the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.</p>

    <p><b>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a marble
       can either:

    <ul>
      <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
      <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color if the space just beyond that marble is clear</li>

    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this
       case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p>
    <p>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. 
      The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to but print out 
      the bad news</p>
    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall heed to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this
       case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.</p>
    <p>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to
       find the children of a node (that is, of a board position we need only find the possible moves from that node, Remember that it is also highly
        desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.</p>
    <p>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would
       work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid
        approach.</p>
    <p>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique. It it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump if it can jump, it cannot
       move ahead one square. This suggests that to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn
        When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where
         each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither
          alternative is very attractives.</p>    
    <p>Next notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble,
       we can talk about moving the marble in a particular apace. if a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible 
       from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every space
        contains a marble, but at least the spaces unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
    </p>  
    <p><b>Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each space, 
      either zero or one moves is possite. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which
       determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
      <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right. the position contains a white marble, 
        the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
      <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We write another method <b>(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position make a move from that position, and
       return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one,
        but here we are more concerned with simplicity) in technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative".</p>

         reverse order, it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in the correct order.</P>
